##The Game:

Sop 'em up is a racing game where the player changes the scenario in order to pass the obstacles or make the path easier if done quickly enough.

###Version 1.1:

Edited last road: New obstacle combination to solve :D

Visual feedback when you complete the run (END letters wrote behind the end).

New background color.

Less steep roads --> better car stability.

Bugs:

Bug where spheres did'nt activate in order is not completely solved, but is not relevant anymore.

It's way not usual, but sometimes, at the game the car starts shaking for some time. It doesn't affect the gameplay tho, it's only visual.

###Version 1.0:

First map completed.

 Caution: There is a bug that happens aproximately 40% of times in the release mode which causes the spheres to activate at any time when they shouldn't, this is caused by Bullet automatic activation.

##Controls:

UP: Gives gas to the car.

DOWN: Activate car brake's, if you are stopped put the car into reverse.

RIGHT: Moves the car right direction.

LEFT: Moves the car left direction.

Key N: New game. Restarts everything.

Number 1: Makes every RED object dissapear. Makes every other colored object appear.

Number 2: Makes every BLUE object dissapear. Makes every other colored object appear.

Number 3: Makes every GREEN object dissapear. Makes every other colored object appear.

Number 4: Makes every colored object appear.


##Victory condition:
Reach the end of the circuit in the lowest time you can! You will listen a "Nice" sound when you get there and your time will reset. If you completed the circuit with less time than your best, the new best time will appear in the window title.

There is also our best time, try to beat it!

##Lose conditions:
- Getting hit by a ball.
- Getting out of the map.
- Knock the car over (in this case you have to reset the game manually with key N).
